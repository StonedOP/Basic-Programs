we can not create a with same name in a package.

if we want to create to classes of same name we can create 2 packages and that will allow us to create
class of same name that can have different use cases.

when we are writing a file we have to mention in which package that file lies at the top

                              ABOUT STATIC
IF in constructor we do (this.staticVAR) java give warning  even though it works
internally java checks when a new obj is created--- at this.staticVar
                                              does that obj i.e naman have a var called population & that's false
                                  then it checks does the Human class has a var population & that's true
                                  & its static var so it does increase it by 1
      it will be the same case when we will be calling the static var use class name

                        DEFINITION
WHEN A MEMBER IS DECLARED AS STATIC IT CAN BE ACCESSED BEFORE ANY OF THE OBJ IN CLASS IS BEING CREATED AND WITHOUT
REFERENCING TO THE OBJECT
i.e. if no obj is created we can still access the static variables
            ANS TO WHY main is static
making main static means we can use main method without creating an obj of that class & main is first thing when we run
& in order to run any thing in class u have to crete obj of that class
            so we should be able to run main without creating then obj of that class
        that's why it is static
SO THESE STATIC VAR , STATIC METHOD BELONG TO THE CLASS NOT TO THE OBJ

in Main line 30
    fun()-> to greeting() -- i see u r dependent on obj so, greeting() where is your obj
greeting()-> to fun() -- oh sorry, I don't have one
    fun()-> to greeting() -- u cant run without  obj IF u wnt to run without an obj make your self static

SO IN   line 34
            we crete an obj for greeting() to eun in static function() fun()



SINCE static stuff or methods do not depend on objects and obj are created during run time
   Hence static stuff or methods is resolved during compile time
