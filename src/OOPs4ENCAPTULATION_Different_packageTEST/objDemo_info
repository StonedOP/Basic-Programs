Line->54 will give error if(obj4 < obj3) as Java will get confused which variable we want it to compare coz we are
creating an obj with a constructor taking 2 arguments

when the equals method uses super.equals(obj) i.e. in Line->25
Line->57,60 in both the cases it says false and not display anything when the (num) value is different
but even if make both values same it still won't print anything
when its equals method is changed Line->26, it will print the Line->61 condition

IF we want to check weather particular thing is an instanceOf some class
                                                                          we use (obj name) instanceOf (class name)
lets we have to check the instance of obj in OOPs4/SubClass


in Object class there is a method getClass() - this provide information about the class of that obj
also this getClass() method can't be overridden because its declared as final
this can als be used to gat information or data about class like other classes,constructors,interfaces etc.


in the Line-61->ObjectDemo , we are trying to compare asn obj  that take to arguments so java will get confused which
one to compare but here we resolve this problem in easy way
we override the .equals() method and make it compare the values we want result of
also we had to use type casting while doing so      because the smaller was getting compared with the larger

but this problem is resolved by using interfaces i.e we have to implement the Comparable interface in our class
of which we are creating and want to compare the object
