2 different classes no matter who their parents are can implement many or same interfaces
we can make the type of the variable as the type of interface i.e.
we should not use interfaces in performance critical situations

if we create an object of -> Media carMedia = new car(); and call the stop function carMedia.stop();it will run
the one in Car class & return "I stop engine like a Normal car."
so if want to change the engine we've to create new class|       that's why we create separate classes for interfaces

we can create different classes for an interface like powerEngine, ElectricEngine
