we can create a default method in interfaces i.e. it can have a body in it and we don't need to override but
we can't have same default method it will create the same problem that we were trying to solve for inheriting multiple
classes
Line->6-Interface B that will give error

in Interface if we want to create a static method
Static interface methods should always have a body-> as it can't be Overridden
also its ca;;ed by using the name of the interface


also the access modifier for the Overridden methods should same or better
e.g.  if in the parent class the method was protected then the overridden method should be protected or public
it can't be more restrictive i.e. private
if its public in parent class then it can't be default as well
