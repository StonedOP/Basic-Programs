Object has a class named Throwable  that handles all the exceptions

Throwable has 1.Exceptions 2.Errors
1.Exceptions -> also has two types A. Checked B.Unchecked
    A.Checked Exceptions ->Exceptions that are checked during compile time      e.g.
    if we are trying to access a file and it doesn't exist then it will raise a file not found exception
    B.Unchecked Exception -> its something that compiler will not be able to detect
       it will only be detected while program is running  e.g
       Arthematic exception like (divide by zero) or null pointer exception (null.something)
2.Errors-> it is something that can't be resolved like stack overflow

throw means that we are throwing an exception
throws is used to declare exception
