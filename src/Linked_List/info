in linked there is not continuous memory allocation , its divided into separate boxes in heep and connected by arrows
this box is called node, where head points to the first item and tail points to last item
when every single item knows about next item

individual box has its own type and properties i.e. int value , whom its pointing to Node next
tail.next points to null
so no one has any idea about other than the next item
so if we want to go to the 3rd node we'll make a temp node and run the for loop 3 times
