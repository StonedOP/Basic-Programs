Encapsulation means
        wrapping up the implementation of data members(like variables) and methods in a class
it hides the data or code into a single entity or a unite so that it can be protected from outside world
the internal making of the class is taken care in encapsulation

the complex things that we have to work with, putting this in calls, making it public,private or hiding the data
members that is encapsulation

it is implementation level

encapsulation means putting things in classes, hiding internal details using public,private methods

encapsulation is the process of containing the information
like objects and other stuff they were all encapsulated

accessing that hidden data that was private l is encapsulation
so we can create a getter method lets say getL() in Box class line11 to access the l private variable in Main line52

encapsulation focuses on hiding the complexity

in encapsulation data can public or private
encapsulation is sub process in data hiding

Abstraction means
        hiding the unnecessary details and showing valuable information
eg. we don't to know the internal mechanics of the car to run it we just need a key to start the car
like ArrayList is called abstract data type
it has some methods like get() and we ue those methods by not carrying how it internally works

it is design level

the this that are visible to me like the get() method

abstraction is done by using abstract class, interfaces

abstraction is the process of gaining the information

**eg in Box class l was made private i.e. data hiding
data hiding focuses on security
like making the  l as private in Package Inheritance Box class line4

so in data hiding data should be private and should no tbe accessed directly



                                            EXAMPLE
lets say we are making a linked list and internally it is implemented as a normal array
we should be able to modify that linked list bye LL.get(),list.update() that is called encapsulation
but , we should not be able to directly access that array
that array should be private that is called data hiding
